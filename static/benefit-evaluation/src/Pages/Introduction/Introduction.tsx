            </h1>
            Benefit/cost management is a strategic approach to evaluate whether
            the investments in a project are justified by the benefits it
            delivers. More info about benefit/cost management can be found
            below.

                            Assessing the benefit a project is expected to
                            deliver, such as improved services or increased
                            sales.

                        <li>
                            Comparing these benefits against the associated
                            lifecycle costs.

                            Continuously monitoring and evaluating development
                            activities to ensure that high benefit-to-cost
                            products are delivered.

                        This will give you a metric to estimate value in
                        development activities, in addition to traditional
                        metrics for time, cost and scope.

                <p>
                    These are some of the typical steps involved in benefit/cost
                    that you would be performing in this app:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Selecting the correct epics for the project (Project
                        configuration)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a goal collection and adding goals for the
                        project (Goal Structure page)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assigning values, either weight or monetary value (worth
                        points) for all the goals (Goal Structure page)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assign cost and time to each epic (Goal Structure page)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assign benefit points to estimate the epics' expected
                        contribution (benefit) to goals (Estimation page)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        View and evaluate the order of how to complete the epics
                        (Analysis page)
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </Box>
            <h2 style={{ paddingBottom: '1rem' }}>Addressing Soft Benefits</h2>
            <Box xcss={boxStyles}>
                <p>
                    Soft benefits refer to qualitative returns that are
                    challenging to quantify in monetary terms, often
                    necessitating implicit methods for assessment due to
                    practical limitations in precise quantification. To address
                    these we use the MISHRI method:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Assign measurable benefits to goals wherever
                        possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Compare and value soft benefits relative to other
                        goals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adjust the benefit value based on the relative
                        importance of each goal.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This approach helps in attributing value to less tangible
                    benefits, ensuring they are accounted for in project
                    evaluations.
